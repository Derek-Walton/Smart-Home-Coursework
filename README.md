# Programming Coursework Smart Home App ðŸ’»

A __Smart Home app__ protoype written in __Python__ using __Tkinter__ (Python's Standard Graphical User Interface Package). This was submitted as the second piece of coursework for the first-year Programming module at the University of Portsmouth.

## Overview

The primary objective of this coursework was to develop a prototype GUI app that interacts with smart home objects. The prototype must provide intuitive user interfaces for managing smart devices, toggling their states, and setting device attributes.

## Main Features

### Fully Interactive GUI 

A fully interactive and working app where you can add, edit and remove devices from your 'Smart Home'.

### Permanent Data Storage

Allows you to save the state of your current 'Smart Home' and upload a previously saved state.

### Device Scheduler

Lets you set specific times for devices to turn on or off automatically.

## Requirements

* Python 3

This project uses __Tkinter__ which is a standard python package that comes pre-installed with Python.
If you're on windows, you can skip straight to the usage section.

### If ran on Mac

Mac Tkinter faces an issue that has yet to have been fixed where the Button widget's background can't be changed. The only work-around to this issue is by installing a extension for Tkinter, [tkmacosx](https://pypi.org/project/tkmacosx/), and importing the [Button widget](https://github.com/Saadmairaj/tkmacosx#button-widget). This solves the issue and allows the Button to function as normal.

#### If ran on Mac without tkmacosx:

#### Dark Mode

#### How it should look:

#### Dark mode

### Installation

To install, run the following command in the shell:

```
pip install tkmacosx
```

After installing tkmacosx, you'll need to run the Mac specified [Frontend File](./frontendMac.py).

## Usage

1. Clone this project
2. If on Mac, [install tkmacosx](#If-ran-on-Mac)
3. Run [__frontend.py__](./frontend.py), if on Mac; Run [__frontendMac.py__](./frontendMac.py)
4. Enter 5 devices

### Input

Upon running the program, the user is prompted via the shell to enter:

1. The __device__ the user would like to add (Smart Plug or Smart Oven)
2. The consumption rate if 'Smart Plug' was chosen (the rate of power consumption)

#### This is repeated 5 times.
Afterwards, the user will be able to manage their Smart Home to their liking.
